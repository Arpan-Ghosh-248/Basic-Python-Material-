### Dream Home Savings Calculator

Consider the situation where you have graduated from Tech I.S. and have an IT job. You have to build a program that helps you calculate how many months it takes to save up for your dream home. The program will take in inputs as specified below and output the number of months it takes to save up for the home. 

The first part does not consider a job that gives a raise, but the second part considers a job where there is a semi-annual raise. 


#### **Part 1**

Write a program that does the following:

- takes following inputs:
    - takes user input of annual salary
    - takes in percentage of monthly salary savings 
    - takes in input of cost of dream home

- outputs:
    - number of months it takes to save up for dream home


_Test Case 1:_

```python
Enter your annual salary:​ 120000
Enter the percent of your salary to save:​ 10 
Enter the cost of your dream home:​ 1000000
Number of months:​ 183
```

_Test Case 2:_

```python
Enter your annual salary:​ 80000
Enter the percent of your salary to save:​ 15 
Enter the cost of your dream home:​ 500000
Number of months:​ 105
```

#### **Part 2**

Write a program that does the following:

- takes following inputs:
    - takes user input of annual salary
    - takes in percentage of monthly salary savings 
    - takes in input of cost of dream home
    - takes in semi-annual raise as percent of annual raise

- outputs:
    - number of months it takes to save up for dream home

_Test Case 1:_

```python
'Enter your starting annual salary:'​ 120000
'Enter the percent of your salary to save:'​ 5 
'Enter the cost of your dream home:'​ 500000
'Enter the semi­annual raise:'​ 3
'Number of months:​' 142
```

_Test Case 2:_

```python
'Enter your starting annual salary:'​ 80000
'Enter the percent of your salary to save:'​ 1
'Enter the cost of your dream home:'​ 800000
'Enter the semi­annual raise:'​ 3
'Number of months:​' 159
```

_Test Case 3:_

```python
'Enter your starting annual salary:'​ 75000
'Enter the percent of your salary to save:'​ 5 
'Enter the cost of your dream home:'​ 1500000
'Enter the semi­annual raise:'​ 5
'Number of months:​' 261
```
