# Roadmaps

![10-day Graduation Plan](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59639763/123875967-2f5e7100-d958-11eb-945c-c7b310279ac6.png)

### Graduation Requirements
- Complete the tree learning modules
- Python Quiz ( 20 min )
  - Perfect Score to Pass (10/10)
  - Use of Google Colab during Quiz is allowed


### Quiz Preparation Tips:
- Put in 4 hours a day for 10 days 
  - studying the PY-10 learning material
- Practice coding!!!
  - Example: build simple calculators 
    - simple interest calculators 
    - compound interest calculators 
    - etc.
- Do many passes of the learning material:
  - complete the first pass quickly going through the motions of typing the code
  - then do a second pass with more detailed studying of the hard to understand sections
  - reach out to tutors for help with the hard to understand sub-topics from the modules
  - find more examples for each sub-topic from internet research and practice it more 
  - review the material more times
